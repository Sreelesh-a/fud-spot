# FudSpot - Swiggy UI Clone

FudSPot is a Swiggy UI clone built using React, Parcel, and JavaScript. This project aims to replicate the user interface of Swiggy, one of India's leading online food ordering and delivery platforms. The project follows a component-driven UI method, ensuring a modular and scalable codebase. Data is fetched from the Swiggy website API using a CORS proxy link to avoid CORS issues.
